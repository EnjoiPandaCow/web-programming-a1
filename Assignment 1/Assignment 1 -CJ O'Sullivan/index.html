My name is CJ O'Sullivan im 19 years old and im from Mooncoin Co.Kilkenny. Im attending Waterford Institue of Technology and studying Software Systems Development.
</p>
    
<p> I still live in Mooncoin with my mam and my brother. But I havent always lived there. For years we moved around Waterford and the surrounding area. I remember having an apartment in town when I was really young, I dont know how I remember but I'll never froget the front door of the place. From there I have seen houses in Ferrybank, Dunmore, Arkeen, Sliverue, a few more places and finally again Mooncoin. Most of my friends have never moved in there life but I think it just makes everything a bit interesting.

<p>
I have alot of hobbies some of which are listed below. I seem to always get into something new and just try my hand at everything. I like having a lot of hobbies it makes life intersting and more then anything it makes it very easy to talk to new people if you know a little bit about everything. Being open minded is the key. I used to be closed minded when I was a teenager but I suppose everybody was. What I noticed was as I got older is other things didn't seem so silly.

By far my favourite thing in the world is <span class="hobby">drifting</span>. More than anyhting else in the would nothng has ever got me more excited than drifting. The noise the tire smoke and the chaos ensues as soon as the first car leaves the line on the Saturday morning. So I have gone into more detail on how <span class="hobby">drifting</span> is judged as shown on this <a href = "table.html">table.</a></p>
