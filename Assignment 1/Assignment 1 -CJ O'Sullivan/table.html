<p><span class="hobby">Drifting</span> is a driving technique in which a driver breaks the rear wheels out of a gripping position and counter-steers the vehicle around a course or track. Generally the line that is designated by a panel of judges is a line that provides the highest speed and angle the car is capable of handling.</p>

        	<th>Style</th>
            <td>Style is probably the most subjective part of the drivers' runs. Style is just what it sounds like: The drivers' overall ability to take the specific judging criteria and display it is the most personal and individual way. That is the essence of style. Aggressive flicks, closeness to walls, extreme angle, degree of difficulty, fluidity and extreme proximity to the lead vehicle (in case of head-to-head competitions) would be examples of how personal driving style can be showcased.
Judges may also use logged drivers speed as a reference or assistance in judging, but speed of drivers is typically used for entertainment purposes, such as those purposes served through TV, live and live stream.</td>

<h2>Qualifiying</h2>

<p>The format for qualifying is a traditional format. Drivers will complete two (2) non-consecutive runs on the track in reverse order of current rank in the Championship. Drivers will receive a score after each run and the top 32 drivers will move on to Head-to-Head competition. In the event of a tie in qualifying, the tie-breaker will first be the Style points allocated followed by rank followed by logged speed.</p>

<p>In the event of rain or weather that does not cause cancellation of qualifying or head-to-head, the judges have the right to make adjustments to the criteria of judging and to subsequently disseminate this information to the spotters and drivers.</p>

<p>In the event that qualifying cannot be completed, such as a rain-out or other circumstances, qualifying order will be established by rank or by previous season points.</p>

        	<th>Clipping Zones</th>
            <td>Cones or other similar marking will designate all clipping points and zones. Anytime an inner clipping point is hit, the vehicle will be considered to be off course, and points will either be deducted. Hitting an outer clipping zone with anything other than the driver's rear bumper will be counted as off course and will be scored a 0 if more than two tires clearly go off course. (ie. Hitting the cone with the rear tire, door, etc.) Course markers that are laid out to designate the outer lines of the course are not to be hit by vehicles at any time in competition. Hitting the markers is considered going off course and a deduction or a 0 may be awarded. Judges will specify in the drivers meeting how they will treat each specific track.
Slight contact with a wall or cone in the outer clipping zone will not result in a point deduction if the hit does not disturb or affect the flow of the drivers run. This means no major corrections were needed after the hit and the driver was still able to maintain proper line and angle. If the hit occurs at any other point on track other than the marked outer clipping zones points may be deducted. If a spin or major under steer results from contact with an outer clipping zone an automatic score of 0 will be given</td>

<p>32 drivers will compete in single elimination head-to-head battles and win his/her way through a standard 32-Driver bracket. Tandem rounds are based on two (2) runs, in head-to-head format, with competitors paired up based on qualifying position. The higher qualifier will lead the first run and the second led by the lower qualifier. The video below makes it easier to understand<p>
