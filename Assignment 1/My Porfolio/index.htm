More than anyhting else in the would nothng has ever got me more excited than drifting. The noise the tire smoke and the chaos ensues as soon as the first car leaves the line on the Saturday morning. This weekend coming is the last round of the Irish Drift Championship, the last of the five. This year has been one of the best years in Irish drifting. Everyone involved in the drifing community was expecting a great season but no one expected anything like the one we got. We had international drivers making their way from Japan and America to this little island at the edge of the Atlantic to see if they could beat the Irish. No one managed Diago Saito, Robbie Nashida, Matt Powers the names go on and on, they all came and they all failed. But how is such a little place so good at a sport that no one knows about or cares about for that matter.
